## Output Requirements

Based on the program analysis provided above, develop an evaluation framework that includes:

* Specific evaluation questions aligned with the program's theory of change
* Appropriate evaluation methodologies (process, outcome, impact)
* Key performance indicators and metrics for each program component
* Data collection methods suited to the program context and population
* Timeline and phases for evaluation implementation
* Stakeholder engagement strategies for the evaluation
* Considerations for equity, cultural appropriateness, and accessibility in evaluation design

Your framework should directly reference and build upon the program model, target population, intervention strategies, and outcomes identified in the Program Analysis section above. Do not re-analyze the program model; instead, focus on HOW to evaluate it effectively.
